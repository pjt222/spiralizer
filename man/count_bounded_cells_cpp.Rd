\alias{count_bounded_cells_cpp}
\title{Fast Bounded Cell Count}
\usage{
count_bounded_cells_cpp(has_infinite)
}
\arguments{
\item{has_infinite}{LogicalVector indicating if cell has infinite vertices}

\item{vertex_counts}{IntegerVector of vertex counts per cell}
}
\value{
Integer count of bounded cells
}
\description{
Counts bounded cells by checking if all vertices are finite.
Much faster than R's Filter() for large cell counts.
